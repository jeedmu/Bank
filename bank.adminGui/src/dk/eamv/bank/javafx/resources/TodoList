TODO list for Bank App SE part

Validation and datatypes (currently domain data is converted to strings, and there is no validation on inputs from user) //Either redo and validate or handle exceptions

Datepickers donÂ´t save data to model

Format strings for display (bigdecimals shows a lot of decimals, should be formatted)

Gui styles (could be prettier, only if needed)

FMXL (POJO views could be replaced with FMXL, cleaner code)

Controllers inherit from baseController (controllers contains redundant code that could be inherited from base)
